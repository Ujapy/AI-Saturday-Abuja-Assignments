      "2/6/19, 3:45 PM - ‪+234 815 485 6090‬: First we need to identify the problems\n",
      "2/6/19, 3:45 PM - ‪+234 907 285 8885‬: Yeah but I wouldn't say problems per say\n",
      "2/6/19, 3:46 PM - ‪+234 907 285 8885‬: More of applications in terms of optimization\n",
      "2/6/19, 3:46 PM - ‪+234 815 485 6090‬: Oh ok!\n",
      "2/6/19, 3:46 PM - ‪+234 907 285 8885‬: Example, image recognition can be used to optimise optimum planting spacing\n",

      "2/6/19, 3:50 PM - ‪+234 815 485 6090‬: I also feel getting first hand information from this farmers can help in identify what this problems are\n",
      "2/6/19, 3:51 PM - ‪+234 815 485 6090‬: For livestocks and this is one area we are not paying more attention on\n",

      "One major issue farmer deal with is airborne diseases.\n",
      "2/6/19, 4:40 PM - ‪+234 907 285 8885‬: Ok diagnosing or developing measurement criteria for this will take a lot of resources. You have to deal with air quality sensor, air temperature. Basically whatever enables airborne diseases\n",
      "2/6/19, 4:41 PM - ‪+234 907 285 8885‬: The applications have to be dealt with from different levels\n",
      "2/6/19, 4:41 PM - ‪+234 907 285 8885‬: We have to start from simple to complex\n",
      "2/6/19, 4:42 PM - ‪+234 907 285 8885‬: I don't know if we are discussing it as a matter of discussion or within the context of submitting a practical write up.\n",
      "2/6/19, 4:42 PM - ‪+234 907 285 8885‬: Discussion there is no limit to what we can apply AI to. Just gotta think it\n",
      "2/6/19, 4:42 PM - ‪+234 907 285 8885‬: Practical then it has to be simple, obvious and impactful\n",
      "2/6/19, 4:43 PM - ‪+234 907 285 8885‬: If it is written as a write up or whatever, bear in mind they may decide to take it up and it might come down for us to implement. I be government worker I no fit involve\n",
      "2/6/19, 4:44 PM - ‪+234 907 285 8885‬: So think simple and practical. Not the almighty problems it can solve\n",
      "2/6/19, 5:09 PM - ‪+234 815 485 6090‬: I think it's good after identifying these issues, ways to improve or automate some operations it's good to document them\n",
      "2/6/19, 5:11 PM - ‪+234 815 485 6090‬: Some of this ideas will be looked into and groups will be formed to think through them and implement if possible as final projects\n",

      "2/6/19, 9:52 PM - ‪+234 802 850 5287‬: kind of missed the conversation, but for agriculture you could do a project for timing planting, i.e predictions on the right time to plant, add fertilizer based on like historical climate data amongst other things etc\n",
      "2/6/19, 9:53 PM - ‪+234 815 997 9124‬: Or how about AI for social good\n",

      "The test project will run for 2-3 days and focused on collecting images and videos of the ongoing Nigerian election campaign materials in your area.

      "3/3/19, 11:39 AM - ‪+234 808 408 3592‬: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), the main cause of maternal death, is difficult to predict. Currently, no accurate screening tools exist to guide healthcare workers in identifying women who would develop PPH. This paper aims to identify risk factors for PPH and determine their predictive probability. We collected data on 2510 women with anticipated singleton vaginal delivery and gestational age greater than 36 weeks over six months in 2004 in obstetrical units of three Egyptian university hospitals. Blood loss was measured every 20 minutes for the first four hours after delivery using a calibrated under the buttocks drape. We defined the main outcome, incidence of PPH, as blood loss > 500mL. Using logistic regression, we analyzed socio-demographic, medical and past obstetric history, and labor and delivery events as potential PPH risk factors. 93 cases of primary PPH were recorded. In multivariate models, antepartum hemoglobin, history of previous PPH, labor augmentation, and prolonged labor were significantly associated with PPH. Post-model predictive probability estimates showed that, to predict PPH significantly, presentation of at least three risk factors is required. However, screening of women with three or more risk factors would only predict 10% of PPH cases. The predictive probability of antepartum and intrapartum risk factors for PPH is very low. No single risk factor or combination of risk factors can reliably predict risk of PPH. Knowledge on the accuracy of predicting primary PPH will help redesign delivery protocols and PPH case management. Due to low predictability, prevention of PPH is recommended for all women.\n",

      "3/9/19, 12:54 PM - ‪+234 808 408 3592‬: 4. Some people get rid of the row that has missing field... I particularly don’t like this approach because you’re most likely going to get rid an important row... that would help reduce bias or improve your prediction\n",
      "3/9/19, 12:58 PM - ‪+234 808 408 3592‬: Imagine you are trying to model a algorithm that would predict the salary range for each employee in a multinational company... so for a reason some fields were missing for assistant directors... removing all the assistant directors rows would mean...your model will not predict adequately the salary range for assistant director roles...\n",

      "3/9/19, 1:48 PM - ‪+234 808 408 3592‬: So the first thing we did was to import the library and the class “imputer”....the function of the imputer is to scan through your dataset and replace your missing values with whatever strategy you intend....\n",
      "3/9/19, 1:51 PM - ‪+234 808 408 3592‬: The we created an object imputer and specified that the missing values in our datasets are denoted by “NaN” and we specified the strategy as “mean”...we can also put “mode” or “median” as the strategy... then we also set the axis = 0 to denote that we want it to go look for the mean of the values in the column and replace the missing values by the mean...\n",
      "3/9/19, 1:52 PM - ‪+234 808 408 3592‬: Then we fit the imputer on our dataset and also transform.... you can’t actually use “imputer = imputer.fit_transform” it will also work.... infact it runs faster...\n",
